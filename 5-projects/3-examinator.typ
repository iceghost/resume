This website provides user interfaces for both examinees and exam authors
to organize mock exams. This helps students experience mock examinations
when COVID-19 was still around.

This was my first real-world team project. I learned how other people develop
software through observing the team.

/ Result: \~300 students / 1 exam and 4 exams / 1 semester over 2 semesters.
