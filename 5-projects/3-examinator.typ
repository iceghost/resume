This website provides user interfaces for both examinees and exam authors to
organize mock exams. This helps students experience mock examinations when
COVID-19 was still around.

_Result_: \~300 students participated per exam, with 4 exams per semester,
over 2 semesters.

This was my first real-world _team_ project. I learned the basics of working
in a team, such as Git workflows, regular stand-up meetings and how different
people develop software.
