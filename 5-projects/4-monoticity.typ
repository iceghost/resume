This tool parses simple monotonicity table construction language and
generates MathJax/LaTeX code. This saves a lot of time spent making those
tables by hand.

_Result_: My underclassmen and friends used and liked it.

This project was my first _usable_ software product. I learned functional
programming and its principles, such as pure functions and side effects. This
project helped me improve my programming skills and mindset.
