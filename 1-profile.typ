== Profile

I am a third-year Computer Science student at HCMUT - Ho Chi Minh University
of Technology and I am interested in pursuing a Software Engineer career,
with a particular focus on Backend Engineering.

In my free time, I keep up-to-date with the latest technology news and work
on side projects. I have a keen interest in programming language designs and
creating products that people will enjoy using.
